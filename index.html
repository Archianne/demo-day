        Our amazing Cohort 12 bootcampers have spent the last 16 weeks on an
        incredible journey, where they've been honing their skills as Junior
        Developers, and now it's time to celebrate!
        <br />
        For the event, we’ll be heading over to our custom built virtual
        exhibition space! You will be able to explore different areas, grab
        virtual refreshments, and meet and interact with the ever growing School
        of Code community.
        <br />
        Our current cohorts of graduating bootcampers will be hosting their very
        own booths during the event, where you will be able to meet them, ask
        questions, and of course, you’ll get to see their inspiring final
        projects!
